This is the readme for David Ivey


The advantage of using Jquery of normal javascript is that jquery has a lot of 
prebuilt methods that add a ton of functionality with very little effort.

For JS and Jquery best practices, we are mostly using Jquery UI to populate our page.
With this, care was taken to ensure that the code was reasonably optomized and neat.
Other than that, functions are standard, selectors are fairly standard, etc.

What prevents posting to another server using javascript is a security protocol
that does not allow for cross-site scripting.
