Homework 2

1. One major advantage to writing a jQuery plugin over regular JavaScript that uses jQuery is that it is very extensible. In addition, a jQuery plugin has a characteristic of in-place inheritance, which allows it to extend from itself. This allows for modular and maintainable code. 

2. Our jQuery plugin adheres to best practices in JavaScript and jQuery development by utilizing simplyfied selectors, and almost all of our selectors are IDs. In addition, all of the variables we used are mostly local, and we avoided using global variables. Also, the variables all have initial values. Finally, we had comments that explained each bit of code as appropriate.

3. One major obstacle that would prevent us from posting high scores to a server on a different domain is that most domains do not just allow other domains to post to it, so we would require POST permission or access to the domain we would like to post highscores to.
