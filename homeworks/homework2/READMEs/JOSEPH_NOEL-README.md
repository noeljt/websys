1) Better management and organization of code, can keep variables more loaclized to their plugin, even if there are variables of a similar purpose within multiple operations on your page. jQuery plugins can also be made into separate files and used on many pages by linking the script in the HTML file.

	Used chaining
	Used local variables/avoided global variables
	All variables have initial values
	Used primitives
	Have comments noting sections of code
