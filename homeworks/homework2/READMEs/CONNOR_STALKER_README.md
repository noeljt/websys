1: 	Jquery is generally easier to use then javascript.  Many of the things you
	do in javascript you can do in jquery in fewer lines of code. jquery by itself
	is lighter than java script.  This should mean that it loads faster than a similar
	script made using java script.
	
2:	We tried to not use global variables and instead use local variables for most functions.
	we also made sure to commnet the code thourghly.
	
3:	Something that could prevent our game from posting the scores to a different domain
	could be that we probably wouldn't have permission to post on the other domain.  In 
	addition we did not save the top scores after you go theough the game so we would 
	have to change the game to save the top scores.
