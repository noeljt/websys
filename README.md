Part 1: Create a repo for your website on Github
=======================================================================
https://github.com/noeljt/websys

Bonus - github hosting:
https://noeljt.github.io
*Please note that github hosting does not support PHP files, so some lab links won't work properly
=======================================================================
Part 2 - Jazz it up:
=======================================================================
CSS Framework:
Started with a "Stylish Portfolio" bootstrap template from StartBootstrap.
https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/

UI Elements:
Used a jQuery UI Progress Bar to graphically display my progress towards graduation.
It is also animated to grow using Javascript/Query.
The percentage will automatically update as the percentage is calculated using Date object.
There is also an overflow/hamburger menu that came with the template, with some color/item tweaking I made.
The template also included a "back to the top" button that appears on the bottom right as you scroll down.

Animation:
Used ScrollReveal to make items appear as you scroll down the page (only once).
This was especially useful to make sure the progress bar started animation only when it is in the view port.
Super easy to use, was surprised.

Graphics:
Top background image was found royalty free using Google images, then I reduced the size (started at over 4k resolution) to improve loading time. I also added a white tint overlay to make the font easier to read.
The JTN logo on the homepage was made by my girlfriend, as were the lab icons.
The Link icons are from FontAwesome; had to change them but there were FA icons the template.
http://fontawesome.io/
The Microformats icon I found royalty free on Google images, and I found a black jQuery logo from the same, then changed it to white in Photoshop.
The image behind the graduation progress was also found on Google images.
The dark blue color I used was #001C38, or RGB(0,28,56).
